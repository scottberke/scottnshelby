<p>This hotel is in walking distance to The Studio Boulder, which is where our welcome dinner on Friday night will be held. There will also be a shuttle to and from this location on Saturday! To get all around Boulder from here we would recommend renting a car, renting a bike, or taking the bus (which is super easy and nice). <br>

-<a target="_blank" href="http://boulderado.com/">The Boulderado</a>: This is a historic hotel in Downtown Boulder that is really awesome. It is my favorite! It is around $250-$350/night depending on what type of deal you can get.
 <br>-Hotels in Longmont (15 min. from Boulder) will be significantly cheaper.
<br>-We also love VBRO and AirB&B for private residences to rent for the week/weekend!
